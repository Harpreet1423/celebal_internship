# Execute basic Linux commands (e.g., ls, cd, mkdir, rm, touch) to manipulate files and directories, with an emphasis on understanding their usage.

## List files
ls â€“ List files and directories
ls -l     # long listing (permissions, owner, date)
ls -a     # show hidden files (starting with .)
ls -la    # both of the above

## Navigate
cd Documents          # go to Documents
cd ..                 # go up one level
cd /home/user/Desktop # go to absolute path
cd ~                  # go to home directory

## Create directory
mkdir newfolder
mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild  # creates nested folders

## Delete file/directory
rm file.txt               # delete file
rm -r folder/             # delete folder and contents (recursive)
rm -rf folder/            # force delete (no confirmation)

## Sample Workflow
mkdir project
cd project
touch  basic_Linux_commands.txt
ls -l
cd ..
rm -r project
