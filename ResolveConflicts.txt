## Branching and merging in Git, Resolve a merge conflicts


Branching in Git
A branch allows you to work on features or bug fixes independently from the main (master or main) branch.

git checkout -b feature-branch

#Merging in Git
#Switch to Main Branch
 git checkout master

#Merge the Feature Branch
git merge feature-branch

 What is a Merge Conflict?
A merge conflict happens when:
You and someone else (or two branches) have changed the same lines in the same file.
Git doesnâ€™t know which version to keep.

Resolve a Merge Conflict 
git checkout master
git merge feature-branch

#Open the Conflicted File
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is content from master branch
=======
This is content from feature branch
>>>>>>> feature-branch

# Edit the File to Fix Conflict
This is the final merged content

#Mark Conflict as Resolved  
git add file.txt

#Commit the Merge
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in file.txt"

#Push the Final Merge to GitHub
git push origin master
